# SDD Dispatch Verification Log

Append-only. Never rewrite prior entries — a later contradiction dates a behavior change.
Format per [verification-protocol.md](../../core/verification-protocol.md).

## 2026-07-22 — agy 1.1.4 (trigger: assertion review; prior notes from ~1.1.1) (from archive/v1.1)

| Probe | Assertion under test | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P11 | `-p` eats next arg as prompt; flag after `-p` silently replaces task | **Confirmed** | `-p --model "Gemini 3.5 Flash (Low)"` → prompt became `--model`, model selection dropped, fell back to default (Claude Opus) |
| P2 | Exit code 1 even on success | **Refuted** (≥1.1.4) | trivial PONG → exit 0; bogus model → exit 1. Normal semantics |
| P5/P6 | Headless auto-denies every tool; even reads need `--dangerously-skip-permissions` | **Refuted** (≥1.1.4) | with NO flags: read succeeded AND write succeeded; no `permissions.allow` pre-seeded in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`. Total behavior flip vs 1.1.1 |
| P10 | Document tasks divert to `brain/<id>/*.md`, stdout banner-only | **Confirmed** | 500-word doc → 1006-byte stdout banner; artifact at `brain/e373…/widget_cache_architecture.md` (3530 bytes) |
| P10 | Sweep command `find … -newermt '-10 minutes'` | **Refuted** (broken) | matched nothing with artifact present; `-mmin -10` works |
| P3 | `--model` takes display label verbatim | **Refined** | labels AND slugs (`gemini-3.5-flash-low`) both accepted; bogus name errors cleanly listing all models |
| P9 | `--effort low\|medium\|high` sets reasoning | **Refined** | works only with base slug (`gemini-3.5-flash --effort low`); **errors** with display label or effort-suffixed name ("--effort is not supported for model …") |
| P1/P12 | Model inventory | **New** | `gemini-3.6-flash-{low,medium,high}` present (3.6-flash-low verified dispatching); no Flash-Lite exposed (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite` and `-3.6-` both rejected); only Pro is `gemini-3.1-pro-{low,high}` |

Not tested: `< /dev/null` hang (kept as-is), silent failure when unauthenticated (couldn't de-auth). (from archive/v1.1)
